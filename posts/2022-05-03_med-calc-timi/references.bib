  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Considerable variability in mortality risk exists
              among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
              Complex multivariable models identify independent predictors and
              quantify their relative contribution to mortality risk but are
              too cumbersome to be readily applied in clinical practice.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and evaluated a convenient
              bedside clinical risk score for predicting 30-day mortality at
              presentation of fibrinolytic-eligible patients with STEMI. The
              Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score for STEMI
              was created as the simple arithmetic sum of independent
              predictors of mortality weighted according to the adjusted odds
              ratios from logistic regression analysis in the Intravenous nPA
              for Treatment of Infarcting Myocardium Early II trial (n=14 114).
              Mean 30-day mortality was 6.7\%. Ten baseline variables,
              accounting for 97\% of the predictive capacity of the
              multivariate model, constituted the TIMI risk score. The risk
              score showed a >40-fold graded increase in mortality, with scores
              ranging from 0 to >8 (P:<0.0001); mortality was <1\% among
              patients with a score of 0. The prognostic discriminatory
              capacity of the TIMI risk score was comparable to the full
              multivariable model (c statistic 0. 779 versus 0.784). The
              prognostic performance of the risk score was stable over multiple
              time points (1 to 365 days). External validation in the TIMI 9
              trial showed similar prognostic capacity (c statistic 0.746).
              CONCLUSIONS: The TIMI risk score for STEMI captures the majority
              of prognostic information offered by a full logistic regression
              model but is more readily used at the bedside. This risk
              assessment tool is likely to be clinically useful in the triage
              and management of fibrinolytic-eligible patients with STEMI.",
