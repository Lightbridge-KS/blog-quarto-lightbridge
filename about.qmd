## Welcome !

:::{#hero-heading}

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a medical doctor who gains interest in software developing and data science. I love computer software and developing tools for others and myself to use in real life and also for fun.

My first programming language is [R](https://www.r-project.org), and now it is my favorite tool to analyse data, build R-package, and build cool [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application.
